# MolecularPro
MolecularPro is an updated version of the Molecular Addon by Jean-Francois Gallant. It is built for the latest version of Blender and it fully apples to the pep8 standards.

## Documentation
You can find all the documentation for the addon on the wiki.

## Building
Currently, Molecular prop can only be built for 64 bit Windows. Support for other systems are coming soon.

To build MolecularPro, go into the `sources` directory and edit the paths in the `setup64.bat` file to match your system.

After you have done that, run the `setup64.bat` file and when it is done you will have a new version of cmolcore.pyd in the root directory.
